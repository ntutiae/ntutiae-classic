## 課程大綱

本課程以“智能工業生產教學工廠”為學習場域，整間工廠完全由北科大跨系所老師帶領學生自行建置，這是一間全國大學第一條由老師帶領學生團隊自行建置完成的智能化生產製造產線，產線包括加工區、精密量測區、線上品管區、組裝區、自動倉儲，從接受訂單到智能化排單、加工、量測、品管、組裝、倉儲，所有雲端伺服器與程式軟體完全由學生自行架設與撰寫，是一條完全無人化的關燈展示生產與教學工廠。

## Course Outline

This course is based on the intelligent manufacturing system education factory which is built by ourselves with seven areas, central server, reception, automatic warehouse, manufacturing, measuring, on-line quality control, and assembly. In process, the raw materials received and scanned by QR code scanner. After scanned, the raw materials are transported to the warehouse. If the producing order received, the raw materials will be sent through all six machines for manufacturing and then be sent to the on-line quality control. The qualified components will be sent back to warehouse, where they will wait to be taken to the assembly area.
