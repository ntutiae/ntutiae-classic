## Course Outline

The primary focus of Workplace Learning Curriculum is to provide students with introductory units on communication, collaboration, analytical thinking, leadership and responsibility, self-management, curiosity and motivation. The 7 skills are a framework for talking about professional skills within the P-TECH model. We are calling out these skills for the IBM P-TECH schools in hopes that our students will begin to develop fluency in discussing them, which will be highly valuable in distinguishing their readiness for internships and?? jobs from their competition.
